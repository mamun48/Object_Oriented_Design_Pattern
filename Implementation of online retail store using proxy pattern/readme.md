# Proxy Design Pattern for Online Retail Store Warehousing

## Overview

This Java program demonstrates the use of the Proxy design pattern in the context of an online retail store with global distribution and warehousing. The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. In this program, a proxy is used to control access to a remote warehousing system, optimizing resource usage.

## Design Pattern Participants

### Subject (`WarehousingSystem`)

- The `WarehousingSystem` is an interface that defines the contract for the remote warehousing system. It declares the method `getInventory()` for retrieving the inventory.

### RealSubject (`RealWarehousingSystem`)

- The `RealWarehousingSystem` is the real subject that represents the actual remote warehousing system. It implements the `WarehousingSystem` interface and provides the real implementation of `getInventory()`. It simulates a remote warehouse with actual inventory data.

### Proxy (`WarehousingProxy`)

- The `WarehousingProxy` is a proxy class that controls access to the real warehousing system. It also implements the `WarehousingSystem` interface. The proxy is responsible for creating the real subject (`RealWarehousingSystem`) only when needed, optimizing resource usage. Additional operations or checks can be performed in the proxy as required.
